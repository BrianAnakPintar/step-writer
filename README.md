### ~~Shared~~ Scuffed Text Editor Program - Writer.
#### A C++ TUI Text Editor 
Yeah, I'm proud of my acronyms.

# Overview.
Step-Writer is a TUI text editor. Which *simulates* vim motions and other customizable features. 
I am doing this because the remote servers at UBC does not have neovim installed... So why not make my own text editor.

**Implemented Features:**
- Selectable title screen logos!
- `h`, `j`, `k`, `l` movements in normal mode.
- Enter insert mode by pressing `i`.
- Press `enter` on the file in the explorer in order to open the file.
- Press `q` to return to main menu. (Probably should change that...)
- You can add your own features by going into the `TextFileViewer.cpp` file.

The project uses [FTXUI](https://github.com/ArthurSonzogni/FTXUI) for the terminal UI components, 
it is a very cool TUI library that anyone planning to make a TUI application in C++ should consider using.

# Installation.
1. Clone the project
2. Once cloned, create a `build` directory by typing `mkdir build` and go to that directory by running `cd build`
3. Next, run `cmake ..`
4. Make the program by running `make`
5. Finally, run the program `./step-writer` from the build directory.

### Todo (soo many things to do ;-;)
1. Better file view hierarchy enabling users to see project structures and directory contents.
2. Fix simple line deletion bugs.
3. Proper cursor movement.
4. Syntax Highlighting.
5. Use a rope data structure.
6. Search functionality
7. `ctrl + c` and `ctrl + v` functionality. The OP copy + paste
8. REFACTOR, REFACTOR, REFACTOR! So many cleanup to do ðŸ˜­
9. Custom keybindings
10. Settings menu
11. `ctrl + z` UNDO functionality.
